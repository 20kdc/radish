Getting started with Radish is easy! Radish has a project generator that will create a folder with everything you need.

```txt
npx create-radish my-website
cd my-website
npm install
npm run dev
```

Or, if you use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com):

```txt
yarn create radish my-website
cd my-website
yarn
yarn dev
```

The default project uses JavaScript. To create a TypeScript project instead, just add `--typescript` to the create command. For example, `npx create-radish my-website` would become `npx create-radish my-website --typescript`.

Once your project is created, visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to get started!
